! What is the value of dvar in cycle3 ?


SEQUENCE CYCLE1 {
    model   first
	condition  99 < 0
    order   1
    }

SEQUENCE CYCLE2 {
    model   second
    order   2
    }	

SEQUENCE CYCLE3 {
    model   third
    order   3
    }
	
MODEL first { 

	define[local] dvar { upper 99 kind 'test' units 'cfs' }
	
	include 'weight-table.wresl'
}

MODEL second { 

	define[local] dvar { std kind 'test' units 'cfs' }
	
	include 'weight-table.wresl'
}

MODEL third { 

	define[local] dvar { std kind 'test' units 'cfs' }
	
	goal[local] g { dvar = dvar[first] }
	
	include 'weight-table.wresl'
}
