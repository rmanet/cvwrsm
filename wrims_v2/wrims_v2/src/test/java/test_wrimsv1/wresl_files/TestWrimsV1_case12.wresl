! What is the value of dvar in cycle4 ?


SEQUENCE CYCLE1 {
    model   first
    order   1
}

SEQUENCE CYCLE2 {
    model   second
	condition  9 < 5
    order   2
}	

SEQUENCE CYCLE3 {
    model   third
    order   3
}

SEQUENCE CYCLE4 {
    model   fourth
    order   4
}
	
MODEL first { 
	define dvar { std kind 'k' units 'u' }
	goal[local] g { dvar = 3 }		
}

MODEL second { 
	goal[local] g { dvar = 2 }	
}

MODEL third { 	
	goal[local] g { dvar = 1 }	
}

MODEL fourth { 
	goal[local] g { dvar = dvar[second] }
}
