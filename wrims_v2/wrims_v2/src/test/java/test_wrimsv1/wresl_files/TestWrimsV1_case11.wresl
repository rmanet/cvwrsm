! What is the value of dvar in cycle4 ?


SEQUENCE cycle1 {
    model   first
    order   1
}

SEQUENCE cycle2 {
    model   second
	condition  9 < 5
    order   2
}	

SEQUENCE cycle3 {
    model   third
    order   3
}

SEQUENCE cycle4 {
    model   fourth
    order   4
}
	
MODEL first { 
	define dvar { std kind 'k' units 'u' }	
	goal goal_a { dvar < 3 }
	include 'weight-table.wresl'	
}

MODEL second { 
	goal[local] goal_a { dvar < 2 }
	include 'weight-table.wresl'	
}

MODEL third { 
	goal goal_b { dvar < 1 }
	include 'weight-table.wresl'	
}

MODEL fourth { 
	goal[local] goal_b { dvar < dvar[second]}
	include 'weight-table.wresl'
}
