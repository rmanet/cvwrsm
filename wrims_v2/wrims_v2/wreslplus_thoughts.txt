0. remove order keyword in sequence



1. if a dvar named X is not in some constraint involving other dvar(s), and is not weighted, 
   then this dvar X has no effect on the computed LP objective value.

2. if the above mentioned dvar X is used in the later cycle, then this model result can be unstable and misleading.
 
 
3. if a dvar's lower or upper bound is defined by state variables other than system variable ( e.g., taf_cfs ), 
   then this is equivelent to a dvar with const lower or upper bound and a constraint with single dvar. 


4. improve current wresl to LP programming standard:
	4.1 integer standard variable means an integer value ( 0, 1, 2, ... )
	4.2 binary  standard variable means a binary value ( 0, 1 ) 



5. global parameter syntax:

	parameter {

		const  A  { 8.9 }
		const  B  { 6   }
		svar   C  { value A+B+K }
		svar   D  { value B*2   }
	}
