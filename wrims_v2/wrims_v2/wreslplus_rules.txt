Wresl+ programming rules

1.	Dvars will not be sent to LP solvers unless they are 
 	(1) constrained or penalized in goals; or 
 	(2) referred in the model's main network
   
	Networks will not be converted to connectivity ( or constraints) unless they are
	referred in the model's main network

1.1     only one main network is allowed in a model


2.	Svars can use 'output' label to write to DSS file. 
	This reduces the need for alias or dvar.   




3.      All reserved IDs should be in lower case. For example, month, jan, feb, etc,..

3.1     all wresl keyword should be in lower case. e.g., svar, dvar, goal, network, etc,..


4  unit conversion function for current month should be consistent with other month. 
   For example, cfs_taf(0) is for current month, cfs_taf(1) is for next month
